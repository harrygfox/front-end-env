# front-end-env
A neat front-end development environment that auto-compiles and minifies sass partials (includes bootstrap).

Sass is great for modularising parts of the stylesheet. 

Minified files are great for the browser. 


------


`npm i` to install all dependencies.

direct gruntfile to your specified source and destination folders.

Those used here are from the uncompiled `scss/main.scss` to the minified `src/css/main.min.css`

`grunt` to run all tasks and watch sass partials nested one folder deep in the `scss` folder.
